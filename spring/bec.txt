    - Part One (interview 3/5)
        - Self-Introduction
        - Do you work or are you a student ?
            - My name is xxx. I'm graduated from GDUPT for three years, and majoring in computer science and tech.
                - GDUPT Guangdong University of Petrol Technology, a university located at west Guangdong
        - What do you like most about your jobs ?
            - What I enjoy the most about my work is that I can start my career in a large company, where I can work
              with the top talents in this field and participating many large transactions. My working abilities and
              communication skills have been improved a lot since I joined this company.
        - Why do you choose to learn English/the major ?
            - It will bring me to the world with a lot more opportunities.
        - How would you feel about having a job interview by phone ?
            - I believe having a job interview by phone has positive effects on both the interviewer and the interviewee.
              For the interviewer, a job interview by phone is quicker and more convenient than arranging a fact-to-face
              meeting, especially for the preliminary stage of recruitment. For the interviewee, a job interview on the
              phone is fair because the usual visual impression is absent. Interviewee can focus on showing the ability
              and commitment during the conversation.
        - What advice do you think would be useful for someone who is going to be interviewed by phone ?
            - Being interviewed by phone is quite different from attending a face-to-face interview. The first thing to
              bear in mind is to be well prepared. The telephone interview would not leave much time for interviewee.
              Getting ready by things like listing key criteria of the job before the interview will be critical. Another
              thing to remember is to keep calm during the interview. Unexpected things may occur during the interview.
              The interviewer may not be heard clearly or the communication failure may occur. Keeping calm is therefore
              suggested for all situations.
        - Why do you think some companies prefer to do job interviews by phone ?
            - I believe some companies prefer to do job interviews by phone in order to save time and money. In the preliminary
              stage of recruitment, a telephone conversation is an effective way to assess the general ability and skills
              of interviewees in a shorter period. Other companies to do job interview by phone to find serious applicants.
              Only applicants that are willing to be interviewed by phone and also getting ready to it should be taken to
              the further process of the job application.

            - Prioritize things > urgent things, efficiency
            - full composition
              When we are ready to plan a working day, there are several points that we should keep in mind to make sure
              everything goes well. The first thing to remember is to make a list of tasks.
              Making a to-do list can help people organize things at work. This is especially important when we plan a
              working day following the holiday, when important tasks can be easily forgotten.
              Emails can be also critical when we are doing business. We should spare a certain period of time at work
              to deal with emails from our colleagues, supervisors and also from business partners.
              The last thing to bear in mind is to prioritize things at work. Urgent things should always come first and
              be processed in time. To prioritize tasks well is the key to efficiency.
              These points should be carefully considered when we make working day plans in order to have a productive day at work.

              I am writing to enquire about your in-store television system we saw advertised in the latest edition of
              The Daily Mirror. We are a country-wide operating chain of sport shoe shops and are considering to provide
              our sales room with flat screens to entertain our customers and to inform them about our latest inventions.
              Due to the fact that we are going to launch a special football shoe next month, we would be pleased if it
              might be possible for you to install about 20 screens within one month. In addition, we would like to ask
              further information about your training lessons and we would be grateful if you could send us your detailed
              brochure as well as your price list.
              I look forward to hearing from you and I would appreciate it to receive your information in due course.
              Yours sincerely,

            - Report on staff turnover
              Introduction
              This report aims to explain the high staff turnover 2008 in Parkside and to propose measures to improve staff loyalty.
              Findings
              The figures clearly show that the high number of staff leaving the stores is a problem that only affect the
              Parkside store in 2008. While staff turnover in the Highgate store remained on a low level, the number of
              staff leaving Parkside shoot up from 5 to 20. This unfortunately has a bad impact on customer service.
              Researcher amongst staff revealed their requirements. Firstly staff requires more training what would also (Conclusion)
              benefit the company as the service is likely to improve. Another good idea is the introduction of a bonus
              scheme for valued staff that would improve staff loyalty. Unlike the mentioned proposals the request for a
              longer annual lave could not be met.
              Recommendations
              It is recommended to offer both the requested training opportunities and a bonus scheme for valued staff.

              After reviewing the activities of our NY store, some measures seem to be necessary to improve the performance
              of the store and keep it open:
              * First of all, we should cut the cost of running by optimising the logistics of the store.
              * Additionally, the store manager should be replaced and some team building activities should be conducted
                because the staff is very unhappy with the present management.
              * In order to rise sales again, we should invest in the one hand in some advertising and on the other hand
                in a new store design. This might also improve the poor store image.
              All measures should start as soon as possible because otherwise we may have to close this very good located store.
