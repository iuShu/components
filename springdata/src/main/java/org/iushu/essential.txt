- Isolation Level
    - Read Uncommitted (Dirty Read)
        - A transaction update a row but not commit yet, another transaction read this row at this time.
        - Once the first transaction rollback the update, another transaction will retrieved an invalid row.
    - Read committed (Non-Repeatable Read)
        - Other transaction will be allowed to read the row after the transaction commit or rollback to this row.
    - Repeatable Read [default in MySQL]
        - Resolve dirty-read issue and ensured multiple read operations can return the same result.
        - Still exist Phantom-Read. (InnoDB used MVCC to solve this issue)
    - Serializable
        - Serialized the operations and adding lock in every row it had selected.

- MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control)
    - A variant of the Row-Level lock, implementing by saving data snapshot.
    - Different beginning time could leads to different snapshot in transaction.
    - Two implementation: Optimistic and Pessimistic.
    - InnoDB implementation of MVCC
        - Available in Read-Committed and Repeatable-Read.
        - Keywords: System-Version-Number, Transaction-Version-Number.
        - Adding two hidden columns to each row, create time and expire time of the row.
        - Saving the system version number in two columns, the number is auto-increment as starting a new tx.

- InnoDB
    - Supports transaction, XA, savepoints, recover safely and online hot-backup, etc,.

- MyISAM
    - Supports Table-Level lock, full-text index, compression and GIS, etc,.
    - Can apply in Read-Only and small data tables, Log application is preferable.
    - Does not support transaction and Row-Level lock.
    - Waiting operation system flush the data regularly to disk. (crash/recover potential risk)
    - Can not recover safely from a crash.
