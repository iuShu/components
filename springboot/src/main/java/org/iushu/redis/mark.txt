- Master/Slave
    - ping every second
    - sync
        - master
            -
        - slave

- Sentinel
    - at least three independent respectively sentinel instances
    - quorum (number of replica to confirm a master failure)
    - deployment (master slave client)
        - 1 master and 1 slave (quorum = 1)
            - sentinel in 1 master and 1 slave
                - no quorum authorized to perform failover
                - split brain issue
            - sentinel in 3 client (quorum = 2)
                - unavailable if connection between server and clients is disconnected
                - unavailable if even one client is down
            - sentinel in 1 master 1 slave 2 clients (quorum = 3)
                - can perform failover if master down
        > 1 master and 2 slave (quorum = 2, recommended)
            - lost write during failover
                - min-replica-to-write & min-replica-max-lag
                - not guarantee replica accept write (just diminish)
                - master will not accept write if replicas are down
